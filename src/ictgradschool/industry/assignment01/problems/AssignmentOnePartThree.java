     * Q2. Complete the method zip that takes two non-negative integer numbers, and returns the decimal zip (which is
     * also an integer). The decimal zip, C, of two non-negative integers A and B is created as follows:
     *
     * 1. the first digit of C is the first digit of A;
     * 2. the second digit of C is the first digit of B;
     * 3. the third digit of C is the second digit of A;
     * 4. the fourth digit of C is the second digit of B;
     * 5. and so forth
     *
     * If one of the integers A and B runs out of digits, the remaining digits of the other integer are appended to C.
     *
     * For example, zip(12, 56) will return 1526
     *                    zip(56, 12) will return 5162
     *                    zip(12345, 678) will return 16273845
